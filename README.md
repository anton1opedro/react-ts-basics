# React TypeScript Basics

This project is a collection of fundamental examples and exercises to learn React with TypeScript. It covers core React concepts such as components, props, state, event handling, and hooks, all implemented with strong typing from TypeScript.

## Features

- Functional components using React + TypeScript
- Props and state with explicit types
- Event handling in TypeScript
- Basic form handling
- Simple reusable components
- Project setup with Create React App (TypeScript template)
